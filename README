This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2658

Tested and works well with Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, PHP, ActionScript (with 'actionscript.vim', available elsewhere in Vim.org), AutoIt and AutoHotKey.  Gradually changes changing syntax colours over the hour. Works well with time script to speech script: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3257

Benefits of script are:
* reduce eye-strain and headaches caused by staring at code on-screen
* reduce dis-orientation by keeping user informed of passing time
* reduce boredom by stimulating right side of the brain

Only affects GVIM. Nothing happens in VIM.

WARNING: running this script uses many Windows resources. Remember GDI % readings on Win98? XP has vastly more of these but they are still limited (*). Because of the way Vim works, a new GDI resources are guzzled when the script 'changes color'.  You may not notice this but that's what happens because VIM creates a new font every update of a color so the script ends up taking many resources it does not need.  You may notice glitches in Windows. If so then this might be the cause. Sorry I couldn't do a better job.  :/
* if anything they use memory
