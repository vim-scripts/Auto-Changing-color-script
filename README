This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2658

Tested and works well with Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, PHP, ActionScript (with 'actionscript.vim', available elsewhere in Vim.org), AutoIt and AutoHotKey.  Gradually changes changing syntax colours over the hour.

Benefits:
+ reduces user 'freezing' symptoms
+ improves space/time-awareness
+ recruits right side of brain brain cells

Disadvantages:
- Under Windows GUI resources are wasted over time due to how VIM changes colors
- Off-putting flicker occurs when color changes

Affects only GVIM. Nothing happens in VIM.

Cursor may blink irregular but simply play with UPDATETIME to correct this.  On my system, default 4000 looks horrible, but 3550 works ok.  Just put set ut=3550 in your _vimrc file.
