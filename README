Inspired by an ex (no pun intended) of mine who was good at producing music . 

Colors chemes are all one color.  But why? That's boring so let's make it creative.

And you don't have to get rid of your beloved color scheme, it  just gives it "A Sharp Kick to the Third Eye" ().

NEW!!  Help file added.  Please be patient, only some function parameters explained.  I will get around to doing more. 

To try it just open the changingColor.vim e.g.
  :e .vim/plugin/changingColor.vim

then try Ctrl-] over the parameters for function Rgb2a().  It's even in the familiar vim help colours
