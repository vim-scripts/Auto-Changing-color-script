Inspired by an ex (no pun intended) of mine who was good at producing music . 

Colors chemes are all one color.  why? let's make it more creative.

And!! you don't have to get rid of your beloved color scheme, just add:
  let permanentColorScheme = "{YOURFAVSCHEME}" * see below

And it becomes active in between edits and :write cycles!

NEW!!  Help file added.  Please be patient, only function Rgb2a() explained.  I will get around to doing more. 

To try it just open the changingColor.vim e.g.
  :e .vim/plugin/changingColor.vim

then try Ctrl-] over wherever you see Rgb2a(Â…).  You can help on the parameters.  It's even in the familiar vim help colours.
