Tested and works well with Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, PHP, ActionScript (with 'actionscript.vim', available elsewhere in Vim.org), AutoIt and AutoHotKey.  Gradually changes changing syntax colours over the hour.

The idea is taken from an old Atari 8-bit screen saver back in the days when they used to sell computers as "cool programming machines"' is to make you look cool while typing in programs.   This script I've tried sitting with hip kids in MacDonalds restaurants in particular, state-of-the art coolness if ever there was one, and while you sit there debugging your software makes you feel like you were in a movie.

On the MAC, when you scroll around using gestures, the "gradual" "screen-saver" mode stays in until you type something or issue movement command with the keyboard.  This is a nice benefit I did not expect, and look quite nice!  Haven't tested on Windows yet though :/ 

Ego aside:

Pro:
+ minimises 'freezing' symptoms with funky effects
+ improves space/time-awareness
+ recruits more of the right side of brain
+ easy to install/uninstall

Cons:
- some Windows GUI resources are wasted over time
- you may experience a little flicker

When you open to edit a file the color scheme will be some normal color scheme, this can be changed by editing the bottom few lines of changingColor.vim by the way.  (*)  After a while, maybe because you've just finished editing some code and you're thinking about what it meant, or you moved to a different area of the file and you're trying to work out what's going on, the gradual effect will come in changing the syntax coloring gradually, light at the end of of the hour and dark in the middle of the hour, in three stylish tints depending on whether it's hour 1, 2, or 3.  Then, as soon as you move, change file you're editing, or go into insert mode the scheme will go back to that normal one, which can be set to your taste.
* The changingColor.vim file gets parked in <userdir>/.vim/vimfiles/plugin on the mac, and <userdir>/vimfiles/plugin in Windows 7.  Simply edit this if you don't like the standard color scheme, it's set on the bottom three lines, it will be obvious.
** in my script's time, not real time, as in hour 1, 2, or 3 of my script's time.

Affects only GVIM. Nothing happens in VIM.

Cursor may blink irregular but simply play with UPDATETIME to correct this.  See demo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1R_W0qTwBc
